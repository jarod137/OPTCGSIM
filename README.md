# OPTCGSIM

#### What it is?


This project offers a way to play the One Piece the Card Game on your personal computer. While we don’t plan on allowing users to play in single player, our current roadmap includes plans to to implement multiplayer using p2p connections. 

#### What does it do?


The project allows users to play the One Piece card game virtually on their computer. It allows for used to build decks using information from the one piece card list website. As of right now, multiplayer is not fully implemented which means that users are not able to actually play the sim, but users will be able to do so once multiplayer is fully implemented as the sim itself can connect to its opponent using p2p connection, but is not broadcasting the moves to the opponent.

#### Running it?


As of right now the only way to run the project is to open it in Godot after cloning and running it locally. However, we do have plans to fully implement multiplayer communication and are currently considering the implications of our p2p setup. 

##### Note(s):

- Once multiplayer is implemented and the project is closer to being complete, the project will be runnable as an `.exe` format.
